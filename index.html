      <br />
      - Learn about cybersecurity (ie. basic of cybersecurity, ethical
      principles, etc.) to prepare myself for Western Regional Collegiate Cyber
      Defense Competition (WRCCDC) via club meetings and supplemented with
      TryHackMe.
      <br />
      - TryHackMe is an online platform for learning about cybersecurity. Each
      topic has a difficulty rating and recommended prerequisite topics to learn
      about and the modules showed lectures before giving us a virtual machine
      to practice the concept on.
      <br />
      - Participate in WRCCDC against other colleges as a blue team (defend
      against attacks) where we have one hour to familiarize ourselves with the
      given network & information systems before the red team (competition
      faculties) attack.
      <br />
      - We had to keep track of privileges of certain users and see if an
      injection attack had occurred (indicated by a change in access
      control/unauthorized access). Additionally, we have to report those
      attacks in a PDF form, noting the time of the attack, what was the damage,
      and who reported the incident (among many other things).

      - Participate in group projects to design websites that the GDSC can
      showcase in club fairs to attract members.
      <br />
      - For my project, I had to work on the home page that showed the basic
      summaries of what GDSC does (more detailed information would be on
      webpages the others worked on).
      <br />
      - I also had to work on the “Why Join Us?” webpage, where the background
      needed to be a colored background that switched to a specific color at
      specific intervals (4 seconds per color) and kept it on repeat.
      <br />
      - Implementing a drop-down menu, which was not taught at club meetings,
      required me to search up how to implement it and I “connected” the menu to
      the other webpages (once they were done) so that when a user clicks on an
      option, it would take them to the corresponding webpage for more
      information.

      - Interact with customers and answer their questions about products
      (particularly, whether certain products are in stock).
      <br />
      - Using the cashier to calculate payments, as well as taking beverage
      orders so that the baristas can start making those orders.
      <br />
      - Additionally, the cashier handles online orders by requesting others to
      package the requested products beforehand and handing them to the delivery
      person when they arrive; in some cases, certain products need to be stored
      in a freezer inside of the kitchen.
      <br />
      - Restock products for the cashiers to get for the customers and tongs and
      trays for the customers to hygienically select products.
      <br />
      - Package products for the customers when certain items are getting low in
      number and for the cashiers due to pickup orders. <br /><br /><br />

      C++
      <br />
      - Used in a personal project where I had to store book information in a
      data structure to practice linked lists.
      <br />
      - I started out with multiple arrays (parallel arrays) that correspond to
      a single aspect of a book (i.e ISBN) with predefined size and I kept track
      of the arrays with indices; there were four operations: Add, Delete,
      Modify, & List All.
      <br />
      - I then transitioned to a dynamic array, allowing the user to set the
      size of the arrays, but everything else remained untouched.
      <br />
      - Afterward, I traded in the parallel arrays for a single array of Book
      objects; the four operations were slightly changed since I needed to add,
      delete, modify, & view objects inside of one array, rather than primitive
      data type from multiple arrays.
      <br />
      - Finally, I transitioned to linked list, with each node representing a
      book & containing a reference to the location of the next book (array
      index were no longer necessary); the operations were changed to match that
      of linked list.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="Body">
      Python
      <br />
      - There are many shortcuts in Python that allow easy management of lists
      and their contents, so it’s the most compatible language to perfect
      sorting algorithms.
      <br />
      - I implemented the bubble sort & insertion sort, two of the most basic
      sorting algorithms since they are iterative algorithms.
      <br />
      - Then I implemented recursive and divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms
      (quick sort & merge sort).
      <br />
      - Merge sort, in particular, was where Python’s list operations shined
      because it involved breaking down the original array into subarrays and
      inserting items from the subarrays back into the original array, so
      appending & removing elements from them became much easier to manage.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="Body">
      Java
      <br />
      - Similar to the personal project with C++, I attempted to do a program
      where I can add, delete, modify, & list objects (in this case, personal &
      professional contacts) in an array; this time, I was focusing on
      practicing inheritance & input validations.
      <br />
      - Each contact has a name, email, & phone number with its “children”
      having (for personal) relationship and (for professional) company name &
      occupation title as additional attributes.
      <br />
      - I asked if the created contact was personal or professional and asked
      for the corresponding additional attributes. Thanks to Java, I can insert
      the “child” into an array of the “parent”, or Contact.
      <br />
      - This was my first project where I implemented the try-catch block to not
      only catch exceptions, but also printed out what the error message was via
      “print()” and put the block inside of a while statement to allow the user
      to input again.
      <br />
      - I also learned how to throw an exception using if-statements,
      particularly InputMismatch to prevent inappropriate input type.

      Git Bash
      <br />
      - For all of the projects mentioned above, I used Git Bash to keep track
      of different versions of the projects; if I make a mistake, then I can
      just use an older version and continue on there instead of re-editing the
      erroneous versions.
      <br />
      - Personally, I preferred creating the repository & branches on the GitHub
      website and cloning them from GitHub.
      <br />
      - Merge (branches), Push, Pull, Show (commits), Add, & Commit were the
      only commands that I needed.
